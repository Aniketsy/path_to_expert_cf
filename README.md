If you get stuckâ€¦

First, remember that you are not stuck unless you have spent more than a day on a single problem. It is perfectly normal to spend many hours on just coming up with the right algorithm.

Read the problem statement again. You might have missed something very important.

Carefully go through the lecture slides. Think about how to apply the basic algorithms covered in class to the problem.

Discuss the problem with friends. Working in teams of size 2 or 3 is strongly recommended. As long as you don't copy-paste someone else's codes blindly, you can even share your (possibly buggy) codes.
